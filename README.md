In this activity I created an App to create tasks with dates, mark them for control and also be able to delete them when they are no longer needed. For its construction, apply my knowledge in JavaScript for managing the DOM and LocalStorage, use CSS for the styles and the responsive effect in different media queries. The entire structure is created in HTML5.
